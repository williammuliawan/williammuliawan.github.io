  <h1>William's Website to be used for stuff</h1>
     <p>Are you alive? <br>Scientists around the world are asking the same question. The meaning of life has eluded the human race for thousands of years, and we still do not know the answer. Bob Bobbity Bob-Bob was the first to ask this question. In his famous book Yee Biu he contemplated the meaning of life. One of the most influential lines of the book, changing the way we see the world today, was "I had some eggs today. They were OK." This shook the foundations of the philosophical world and changed the way people view the meaning of existence. Bob-Bob's book inspired those in the 29th century to seek out the truth behind life. To quote Bob Bob-Bob, "I'm glad the book had such a wide impact, but how does a cookbook make people contemplate life?"<br>Throughout the 30th century, people conducted studies until another great philosopher, Ika Iki changed the game again by asking the following question in a press conference: "Maybe the meaning of life is eating sofas?" This question lifted the US out of a Great Depression and was widely renowned as the bringing of world peace. Iki won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2986, leaving him very happy and very confused.<br>Iki's contribution was the spur for the genetic revolution, where they made peanuts Allergy-free and eggplant edible. However, the Genetic Revolution also lead to the controversy about designer babies but was resolved by the babies getting coding jobs. Now, Earth is considered one of the greatest planets ever, according to the award-winning magazine "I like eggs" (named after Bob-bob's book). Everyone on Earth now eats SCD and watches anime.</p>
